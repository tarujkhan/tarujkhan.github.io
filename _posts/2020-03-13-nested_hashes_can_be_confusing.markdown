Hashes in general is not as confusing. But nested hashes can be confusing since you have to jump into one hash at at time. You also have to keep in mind if the hash has a string, symbol or an array because different methods will apply for different data types. My first time doing nested hashes threw me off. But once I started to get deeper into the hash with the hash methods, I was okay.
